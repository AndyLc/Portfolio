          Rend is an animation collective that aims to share the work of animators, artists and storytellers of all backgrounds and experiences.
          Through featuring short animated films and interviews with their creators, we strive to give animators a strong promotional platform to connect with their audiences.
          We love authentic and engaging storytelling, and hope to house a growing array of the best short-form animation in the world.
